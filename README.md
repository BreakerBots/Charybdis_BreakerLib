This project contians the off-seasion code for our robot, Charybdis. This Project was built with, and is currently the primay development ground for, BreakerLib. 
## BreakerLib
BreakerLib is team 5104's general library for integrated robot preformance. This allows us to rapidly develop complex functionaly with greater confidence than what would outherwise be possible without BreakerLib. This is all made incredably easy with BreakerLib's rich ecosystem of intagrated features, such as automated diagnostics, and much more!




NOTE: BreakerLib is still under development
